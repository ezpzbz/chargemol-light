This program performs atomic population analysis to determine DDEC net atomic charges, atomic spin moments, and bond orders. Because the DDEC net atomic charges are simultaneously optimized to reproduce atomic chemical states and the electrostatic potential surrounding a material, they are well-suited for constructing force-fields used in atomistic simulations (e.g., classical molecular dynamics or Monte Carlo simulations) and for quantifying electron transfer between atoms in complex materials and during chemical reactions.

The program analyzes electron and spin density distributions generated by a quantum chemistry (e.g., DFT, coupled-cluster, etc.) calculation performed with a software such as VASP, Gaussian 09, CP2K, GPAW, SIESTA, ONETEP, etc.

The program is written in Fortran and parallelized using OpenMP. The program can be run in serial (one-processor) or parallel (multi-processor) modes. It runs on Linux and Windows operating systems.

Installation and usage instructions are in the instructions_09_26_2017.pdf file of the chargemol_09_26_2017.zip archive.
