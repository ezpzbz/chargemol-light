 Bonded to the (  0,   0,   0) translated image of atom number     2 ( O  ) with bond order =     1.4448    The average spin polarization of this bonding =     0.0000
 Bonded to the (  0,   0,   0) translated image of atom number     3 ( O  ) with bond order =     1.4448    The average spin polarization of this bonding =     0.0000
 The sum of bond orders for this atom is SBO =        2.889536
