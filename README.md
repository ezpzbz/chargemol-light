# chargemol-light
Unofficial mirror of [Chargemol](https://sourceforge.net/projects/ddec/files/) code for DDEC calculations.

## Disclaimer
It is just a light version of the code which only contains the source code for Linux plus slight modification
in formatting the output of atomic spin file.
For examples and binaries and complete version of the code please visit the main webpage.

## Compile
It is tested using GCC>9.
There is a `compile_gfortran.sh` file in `src` directory. Running it should generate `ddec_par` executable which 
is the parallel version of the code.
